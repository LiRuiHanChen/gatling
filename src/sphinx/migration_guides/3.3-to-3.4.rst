.. _3.3-to-3.4:

#########################
Migrating from 3.3 to 3.4
#########################

.. warning::
    There's a know issue with ``headerRegex`` that forces you to force the parameter to a String
    when using the predefined HTTP header names constants, eg ``header(HttpHeaderNames.ContentType.toString, "bar")``.
    Sadly, this is something we'll only be able to fix in Gatling 3.5.0.

.. note::
    Gatling 3.4 is not binary compatible with previous versions.
    Any code compiled with a previous version must be recompiled in order to be executed with Gatling 3.4.
    Changes listed below are only about source compatibility changes.

* Core:

  * the Session based versions of ``transform`` and ``transformOption`` were renamed into ``transformWithSession`` and ``transformOptionWithSession``.
  * ``xpath`` check's namespaces are now a ``Map[String, String]`` instead of a ``List[(String, String)]``
  * Configuration option in ``gatling.config`` related to ssl, sockets, and netty were moved around in an effort to share amongst multiple protocol supports, eg MQTT (FrontLine).

* HTTP:

  * ``hostNameAliases`` now takes a ``Map[String, List[String]]`` instead of a ``Map[String, String]``
