SBT plugin
##########

This SBT plugin integrates Gatling with SBT, allowing to use Gatling as a testing framework.

Versions
========

Check out available versions on `Bintray <https://bintray.com/gatling/sbt-plugins/gatling-sbt/view>`_.

Beware that milestones (M versions) are not documented for OSS users and are only released for `FrontLine <https://gatling.io/gatling-frontline/>`_ customers.

Setup
=====

In ``project/plugins.sbt``, add::

  addSbtPlugin("io.gatling" % "gatling-sbt" % "MANUALLY_REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_VERSION")

You'll also need those two dependencies::

  "io.gatling.highcharts" % "gatling-charts-highcharts" % "MANUALLY_REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_VERSION" % "test"
  "io.gatling"            % "gatling-test-framework"    % "MANUALLY_REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_VERSION" % "test"

And then, in your ``.scala`` build::

  import io.gatling.sbt.GatlingPlugin

  lazy val project = Project(...)
                     .enablePlugins(GatlingPlugin)
                     .settings(libraryDependencies ++= /* Gatling dependencies */)


or in your ``.sbt`` file, for SBT 0.13.6 and later::

  enablePlugins(GatlingPlugin)

  libraryDependencies ++= /* Gatling dependencies */

Demo sample
===========

You can find a `sample project demoing the gatling-sbt-plugin <https://github.com/gatling/gatling-sbt-plugin-demo>`_ in Gatling's Github organization.

You can also use the :ref:`Giter8 template <g8-template>` to bootstrap your project.

Usage
=====

As with any SBT testing framework, you'll be able to run Gatling simulations using SBT standard ``test``, ``testOnly``, ``testQuick``, etc... tasks.
However, since the SBT Plugin introduces many customizations that we don't want interfering with unit tests, those commands are integrated into custom configurations,
meaning you'll need to prefix them with `gatling` or `gatling-it`, eg. `gatling:test` or `gatling-it:test`.

.. note::

  This behavior differs from what was previously possible, eg. calling `test` without prefixing started Gatling simulations.
  However, this caused many interferences with other testing libraries and forcing the use of a prefix solves those issues.

'Test' vs 'Integration Tests' configurations
============================================

This plugin offers two different custom SBT configurations, named ``Gatling`` and ``GatlingIt``.
They are tied to different sources directories (see next section for more details) and therefore allow to separate your simulations according to your needs, should you desire it.

Ideally:

* Your simulations with low injection profiles, which may serve as functional tests, should live in 'src/test' (the default source directory for the ``Gatling`` configuration), and run along your unit tests, since they would complete quickly
* Longer, more complex simulations with high injection profiles, should live in 'src/it' (the default source directory for the ``GatlingIt`` configuration) and be run on a as-needed basis.

Also, since they're tied to separate SBT configurations, your SBT settings can then be customized per configuration.
You can expect a relatively short simulation to run easily with the default JVM settings, but simulations with much higher load can very well require an increase of the max heap memory allowed for example).

.. note::

  When using the ``GatlingIt`` configuration, you must use the ``gatling-it`` prefix, e.g. ``gatling:test`` becomes ``gatling-it:test``, etc...

Default settings
================

For the ``Gatling`` configuration :

* By default, Gatling simulations must be in ``src/test/scala``, configurable using the ``scalaSource in Gatling`` setting.
* By default, Gatling reports are written to ``target/gatling``, configurable using the ``target in Gatling`` setting.

For the ``GatlingIt`` configuration :

* By default, Gatling simulations must be in ``src/it/scala``, configurable using the ``scalaSource in GatlingIt`` setting.
* By default, Gatling reports are written to ``target/gatling-it``, configurable using the ``target in GatlingIt`` setting.

If you override the default settings, you need to reset them on the project, eg:

::

  scalaSource in Gatling := sourceDirectory.value / "gatling" / "scala"
  lazy val root = (project in file(".")).settings(inConfig(Gatling)(Defaults.testSettings): _*)

Additional tasks
================

Gatling's SBT plugin also offers four additional tasks:

* ``gatling:startRecorder``: starts the Recorder, configured to save recorded simulations to the location specified by ``scalaSource in Gatling`` (by default, ``src/test/scala``).
* ``gatling:generateReport``: generates reports for a specified report folder.
* ``gatling:lastReport``: opens by the last generated report in your web browser. A simulation name can be specified to open the last report for that simulation.
* ``gatling:copyConfigFiles``: copies Gatling's configuration files (gatling.conf & recorder.conf) from the bundle into your project resources if they're missing.
* ``gatling:copyLogbackXml``: copies Gatling's default logback.xml.

Overriding JVM options
======================

Gatling's SBT plugin uses the same default JVMÂ options as the bundle launchers or the Maven plugin, which should be sufficient for most simulations.
However, should you need to tweak them, you can use ``overrideDefaultJavaOptions`` to only override those default options, without replacing them completely.

E.g., if you want to tweak Xms/Xmx to give more memory to Gatling::

  javaOptions in Gatling := overrideDefaultJavaOptions("-Xms1024m", "-Xmx2048m")
